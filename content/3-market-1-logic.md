# Market Operational Procedures

## A) Free Market
A free market is a market where participants engage voluntarily.

## B) Necessary Conditions for Market Operation:
- Product.
- Demand for the product.

## C) Market Goals:
- Facilitation of trade.
- Location.
- Time frames set by the market.

## D) Market Functioning is Linked to:
- The product.
- Demand for the product.
- Activities aimed at increasing prices through surplus.
- Activities related to time regulation.

## E) The Market Promotes Opportunities by Offering a Price Different from the Value:
- The reaction to this opportunity may be absent.
- The reaction may be present, utilizing this opportunity.
- The reaction may be opposite, triggered by an activity not perceived by the market at the moment.

## F) The Market is Controlled and Regulated Through the Distribution of Price and Time, Creating Types of Natural Organization that Establish Balance ("fair" zone where bilateral trade occurs).

## G) The Combination of All These Components in an Active Phase is Called Market Activity:
- Market activity consists of a series of events related to price and time, with "TPO" as the basic unit of market measurement.

## H) Market Activity is an Expression of the Participants' Needs, Driven by:
- Time frames imposed by the market.
- Participants' own time frames.

# Market Volatility

Market volatility depends on the combination of long and short time frames set by the market and participants.

1) Market activity generates information:
- A readable preference for various time and price opportunities that arise at different times, at different or identical prices, at different or identical volume levels. This is an expression of accepted, rejected, or changing value by participants as a whole.
- Time-price opportunities (and therefore prices) may arise with a greater or lesser relative amount of time.
- Those time and price opportunities that require a large amount of time should result in high transaction volumes and reflect market recognition or value for both parties during that period.
- Those time and price opportunities that require a small amount of time should result in low transaction volumes and reflect market rejection or unfair value for one of the parties during that period.
  This leads to a distinction in market prices.
- Accepted prices versus excessive prices.
- An additional distinction in the type of market activity can be made within the acceptance/rejection framework.
- Prices in market-created opportunities that are responded to, versus prices in market-created opportunities that are influenced by other initiating forces. Therefore, Price + Time = Market Acceptance (responsive or initiating) = Transaction Volume = Market Value (definition of all free markets).

## J) All markets, despite possibly having different structures (dealer, auction house, exchange market, etc.), are nonetheless driven by the same forces and operate based on these basic principles.
- Traders and investors must understand sound market logic so they can extract and analyze the information generated by the market to meet their specific needs in each market.

# Market Actions to Create Activity

## A) Needs and Interests of Participants
The needs and interests of participants, which collectively determine market activity, are multiple and diverse, and may vary across different time intervals, not balanced in the nearest time interval. These needs and interests are not necessarily balanced within the time intervals beyond the nearest parameter.

## B) Achieving Balance
To achieve balance, the market focuses on the dominant set of one or more news items or real or imagined events and neutralizes them in a very short perspective by offering a range of prices to determine an area that defines trade. In doing so, the market makes the situation fair for both sides in the nearest time interval.

## C) Continuation of Trading
Once balance is found, the market will continue to trade in this fair area until other news or changes in the near or long-term time interval disrupt the balance, shifting it to another area. This new balance can be altered by a new set of events or active participants. This process may be continuous or opposed in its nature, and the initial dominant event may, in the short-term perspective, be quick and volatile.
- Thus, the dominant event usually motivates short-term participants to change the price to create fairness.
- The dominant event usually does not motivate long-term participants. It is often driven by the acceptance of the "fair price area" as a market-created opportunity or price excess in its short-term perspective. In other words, long-term activity may disrupt the balance created in the short-term perspective.

## D) Market Offering
The market offers a pair of time-price opportunities that participants can respond to. These actions or inactions determine the structure of the market. The market fluctuates to attract the participation of all time frames in the short-term perspective. The price area that is accepted is the only area that is most used, so this price area that defines trade reflects market value.

## E) The market always offers various time-price opportunities to maintain this activity.

## F) Unacceptable Prices
Unacceptable prices are either overvalued or undervalued, used to find balance. These prices motivate long-term buyers/sellers, either encouraging participants to agree or act, and serve as reference points for short-term participants.

## G) These overvalued or undervalued prices are always present in the market to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the volatility and frequency of changes among participants, which depend on the forces of time frame influence.

## H) Controlling Function
The market regulates itself and performs a controlling function that is included in the facilitation of trade. For this purpose, when the price becomes attractive to buyers or sellers, and at the same time, the price moves away from the extreme balance zones, it becomes attractive for actions by other participants, and at this time, creating an opportunity for trade. Thus, the created market opportunity will not last long due to increased competition for the use of this opportunity. This makes time a controlling factor in the market.

# Market Characteristics

## A) All markets are primarily auction markets.
- There are two categories of auction markets.
- Active auction - the range expands during negotiations.
- Passive auction - the range is already determined in a preset offer.
- Active auctions can move from low to high or from high to low. During the auction, the market will continue to move in the same direction to facilitate trade until the last buyer or seller participates.
- All prices change relative to the previous price to satisfy market conditions.

## B) Participants have a spectrum of time perspectives during which they act. For convenience, participants can be classified into two categories according to their time perspective.
- Those who are close to the short-term perspective (or day) - short time frames.
- Those who are far beyond this parameter - long-term (or other) time frames.
- Those who have different time frames, different approaches to working in the market.
- Short (daily) time frame - searching for fair value in a short period.
- Long-term (other) time frame - searching for market-created opportunities where it is related to the participantâ€™s individuality, selective type of activity.

## C) The level of activity for time frames is as follows:
- The activity of participants with a short time frame usually constitutes the majority of the trading volume in a given time interval.
- The activity of participants with a long-term time frame usually constitutes a small part of the volume in the same time interval.
- The level of trading for a short time frame participant ranges from active to passive.
- The level of trading for a long-term time frame participant ranges from passive to active.
- The total trading volume for both types of participants accordingly affects the structure of the market.

## D) Regardless of whether prices are in surplus or deficit, they facilitate trade in the short-term time frame, creating attractiveness for the long-term perspective buyer or seller, and will not be attractive to the short-term perspective seller. Thus, the desire of a participant for a long-term buyer and a long-term seller conflicts with the duration at the same price and in the same period. Accordingly, long-term buyers never buy from long-term sellers. Thus, the entirety of the market participants consists exclusively of those participants with a long-term perspective who trade with each other.

## E) Where prices facilitate trade, and thus, are fair in the short-term time frame, the price or price area that is attractive to the short-term perspective buyer will be attractive to the long-term perspective seller.

## F) A normal trading pattern assumes that a short-term trader conducts deals with a long-term trader, creating various combinations of buyers and sellers: long-term perspective against short-term perspective. Each combination leads to different amounts throughout the range structure.

## G) Participants may and will change their time perspective depending on the situation and relation to activity. This leads to an increase or decrease in market activity.
- A long-term participant, when deciding to exit their trading position, has an advantage and begins trading in the short-term time frame, becoming a short-term participant because their needs and goals, expressed in market activity, become identical to the needs and goals of other short-term participants. This increases market activity.
- Similarly, when long-term participants increase their time perspective, market activity decreases. Moreover, when long-term participants pass by a market-created opportunity, market activity declines.
- When a short-term participant extends their time perspective, they become a long-term time frame participant, which reduces activity.
- When a short-term participant shortens their time perspective, activity increases.
- Regardless of time perspective, those who occupy positions in inefficient markets may seek to exit positions within any time frame.
