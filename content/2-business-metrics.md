- **Significance:** A primary indicator of revenue stability in SaaS.

### Revenue Growth Rate
- **Description:** The percentage increase in revenue over a specified period.
- **Formula:** \( \text{Revenue Growth Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Revenue This Month} - \text{Revenue Last Month}}{\text{Revenue Last Month}}\right) \times 100\% \)
- **Significance:** Important for determining the growth rate of the company.

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
- **Description:** Measures the company's ability to retain revenue from existing customers considering expansions, contractions, and losses.
- **Formula:** \( NRR = \left(\frac{\text{Initial MRR} + \text{Expansions} - \text{Churn} - \text{Contraction}}{\text{Initial MRR}}\right) \times 100\% \)
- **Significance:** Indicates the health of the business and its potential for long-term growth.

### Churn Rate
- **Description:** The percentage of customers who have discontinued the service.

- **Significance:** Reflects customer satisfaction and retention issues.

### Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- **Description:** Average revenue generated per user over a specific period.
- **Formula:** \( ARPU = \frac{Total Revenue}{Average Number of Users} \)
- **Significance:** Helps understand revenue generation efficiency per user.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

- **Formula:** \( LTV = ARPU \times Average Customer Lifetime \)
- **Significance:** Critical for assessing the long-term value of customers and guiding financial forecasting.

### Inventory Turnover Ratio

### Gross Profit Margin
- **Description:** Represents the percentage of total sales revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.
- **Formula:** \( \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Total Revenue}}\right) \times 100\% \)
- **Significance:** Essential for understanding the profitability of core business activities.

### Operating Cash Flow

### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
